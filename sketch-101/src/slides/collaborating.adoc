== Collaborating with Zeplin

There is no easy way to collaborate with a developer if they don't have Sketch installed.

Instead of making them download a $99 program, using Zeplin will allow you to send over design assets, colors, font sizes, etc. to your developer. 

Using the built in comments feature allows you to leave notes on functionality.



== Using Zeplin

1. Sign up for an account at http://zelplin.io[zeplin.io] and download the mac app
2. Download the https://zeplin.io/support.html#plugin[Sketch plugin]
3. Export your artboard to Zeplin
4. Optional: Create assets using the 'Single Layers' export. They will automatically show up in Zeplin.
