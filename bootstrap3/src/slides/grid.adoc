== The Bootstrap Grid System

== The Grid

== The Grid
Bootstrap is based on a 12-column grid, and uses CSS classes to decide the width of each element.

== The Grid
Each element can take up between 1-12 columns worth of space...

== Rules of The Grid
* Rows must be placed within a `.container` (fixed-width) or `.container-fluid` (full-width) for proper alignment and padding.
* Use rows (`.row`) to create horizontal groups of columns.
* Content should be placed within columns, and only columns may be immediate children of rows.

== Example
[source, html, style="width: 100%"]
<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
        [CONTENT FOR ROW]
    </div>
</div>

== Column Classes

== In other words...

If you want to have two 50% columns on a mobile phone, you would use `.col-xs-6` nested in a `.row`, and the rows would be consistent on every device...

== Two 50% width columns

[source, html, style="width: 100%"]
<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-xs-6">
            [COLUMN 1 CONTENT]
        </div>
        <div class="col-xs-6">
            [COLUMN 2 CONTENT]
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

Two 50% columns on a mobile phone

== Four 25% width columns

If you want to have four 25% columns on a desktop, and would like them to break to 100% on a tablet, you would use .col-md-3 nested in a .row.

== Four 25% width columns

[source, html, style="width: 100%"]
<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-4">
            [COLUMN 1 CONTENT]
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
            [COLUMN 2 CONTENT]
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
            [COLUMN 3 CONTENT]
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
            [COLUMN 4 CONTENT]
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

Four 25% columns on desktop that break to 100% width on a tablet.
